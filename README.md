🚶 Human Detection System 🚶‍♀️
An OpenCV and Scikit-learn Powered Solution for Identifying Humans in Images



 ## ✨ Overview

Welcome to the Human Detection System! This project leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning to accurately identify human figures within static images. Built with OpenCV for image processing and scikit-learn for classification, this system employs the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features combined with a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to achieve robust human presence detection.

Whether you're building surveillance applications, robotics systems, or simply exploring the fascinating world of object detection, this repository provides a clear, concise, and effective starting point.

🚀 Features
HOG Feature Extraction: Utilizes the highly effective Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor for robust feature representation of human shapes.

Linear SVM Classifier: Employs a Linear Support Vector Machine for efficient and accurate classification based on extracted HOG features.

Modular Codebase: Clean and well-structured code for easy understanding and extension.

Model Persistence: Ability to save and load the trained SVM model for future use without retraining.

Comprehensive Evaluation: Includes classification report and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

Flexible Testing: Supports testing on single or multiple new images to visualize detection capabilities.

💡 Usage
The core logic of the human detection system is demonstrated within the Jupyter Notebook.

1. Prepare Your Dataset
Ensure you have a collection of positive (human) and negative (non-human) images.

Place your human images in the data/pos_person directory.

Place your non-human images in the data/neg_person directory.

The code is configured to look for these paths:

Python

pos_path = "../data/pos_person"
neg_path = "../data/neg_person"
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the human_detection.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook):

Bash

jupyter notebook
Execute the cells sequentially. The notebook will guide you through:

Importing Libraries: Essential tools for data manipulation, image processing, and machine learning.

Viewing Sample Images: A quick visualization of the dataset's content.

Preparing Dataset (HOG Features): Extraction of HOG features from images and labeling them.

Train/Test Split: Dividing the dataset for model training and evaluation.

Training SVM Classifier: Training the Linear SVM model on the HOG features.

Evaluating the Model: Displaying classification report and confusion matrix to assess performance.

Saving and Loading the Model: Demonstrating how to persist the trained model.

Testing Detection: Applying the trained model on new, unseen images to predict the presence of humans.

3. Test on Your Own Images
To test the system on new images:

Place your desired test images in the data/predictTestImages folder.

Run the final sections of the Jupyter Notebook to see the real-time predictions.

📊 Model Performance
The trained Linear SVM model demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing between human and non-human subjects based on HOG features.
